Why Github?
-----------

* Github is a more natural social network for a group of developers than Meetup.com.  
* Less spam
* Because Github is free and [Meetup.com is not](http://www.meetup.com/help/Does-it-cost-money-to-start-a-Meetup-Group).

Organizers
----------

* Scott Szarapka ([Github](https://github.com/szarapka) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scittszarapka))
